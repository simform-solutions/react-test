#How Program Works :
#Frontend : 
1. I added product list table view in product admin panel and added admin panel layout with sidebar and header. Created some custom components to demonstrate react.js skill set.(I am aware that design wasn't important for you, by mistake spent some more time on design side.)

2. Used react.js, Redux, React-router, error-boundries, appolo client in front end application.

3. I was supposed to build react.js front end application with graph QL endpoints but couldn't get time to do that due to 4 hrs limit.

#Backend
1. Created schema for product list and created mutation to add product.

2. Used express, mongoose, graph QL and used mongo DB(MLab) as a database.
