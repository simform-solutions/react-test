This repository contain two folder one for front end and another for backend.

## Start Instructions server: 
cd server && node index

## Start Instructions client: 
cd product-admin-panel && npm start

## Forked from my own github repository.

## How Program Works :
## Frontend : 
1. I added product list table view in product admin panel and added admin panel layout with sidebar and header. Created some custom components to demonstrate react.js skill set.(I am aware that design wasn't important for you, by mistake spent some more time on design side.)

2. Used react.js, Redux, React-router, error-boundries, appolo client, EsLint in front end application. 

3. I was supposed to build react.js front end application with graph QL endpoints but couldn't get time to do that due to 4 hrs limit.

4. Added some HOCs like asyncRender, privatRoute , presenter with redux

## Backend
1. Created schema for product list and created mutation to add product.

2. Used express, mongoose, graph QL and used mongo DB(MLab) as a database.

## Bugs and Pending Items
1. API binding on front end side is pending due to time constraint.

2. Add product in express server had one small bug due to type error.

3. Jest test case is pending to add.

## Suggestions
1. I could use story book for componenets but did't added that due to limited time.
2. Added SCSS in the project but could use stylus for better formatting.
3. Could add pre-commit hook with husky to prevent pushing buggy code.
4. I could use server side rendering for website crawling.
5. I could use recompose for functional components.
